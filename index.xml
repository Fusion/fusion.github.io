      <description>I was totally not completely wrong to buy a mid 2010 Mac pro!
&amp;hellip;because of course right after I bought it, it was discontinued. And I bought it for teh upgradez!
Anyway, I just:
1. Upped its RAM amount to 32GB (Apple begrudgingly updated their web site to finally admit that, yes, 8GB sticks are supported) (http://www.frys.com/product/8008624?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG)
2. Switched to a 980GB Patriot Ignite SSD (http://frys.com/product/8358357?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG)
3. Swapped the video card for my &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; PC&amp;rsquo;s GTX660 &amp;ndash; not officially supported but totally works except EFI boot.</description>

      <description>This is so ridiculous. Hearing the same folks who claim that gun control doesn&amp;rsquo;t work are now making the case that terrorists attacks could be prevented by forcing cell phone vendors to hand over encryption keys.
You have to pick one: either the bad guys go through alternative channels than honest people, as can be the case with guns, or they don&amp;rsquo;t. In case you do not understand that, the baddies do not have to use the same encryption methods as other users, either.</description>

      <description>As a fairly recent LG urbane owner, I felt sad that so many great faces have a dim mode that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look near as good as their bright mode.
So I put together this small racket app: https://github.com/fusion/Watch-It-/releases
It does the stupidest thing: it attempts to make a face&amp;rsquo;s bright settings also its dim settings.
It will not work with protected faces and will likely also not work it a face makes heavy usage of scripting.</description>

      <description>Lately, too much work has gotten in the way of posting about non-work related projects(!)
So, quickly:
I pushed to Github the code for my new aggregation/blogging engine: https://github.com/Fusion/HereNote
More information: http://nexus.zteo.com/HereNote--publish-your-thoughts
Then, I wrote a init process replacement for containers such as Docker instances: https://github.com/Fusion/cfr_reaper
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t do everything init do, but it keeps your containers from being overrun with zombie processes.
Also, sbase-for-android, which is obviously an Android project, is a lightweight and MIT licensed replacement for Busybox.</description>

      <description>Not an issue, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure where to post this tip: And, yes, I am aware that you may then want to protect your ZeroNet install(!)
Here is a typical configuration:
 Host machine runs haproxy ZeroNet in a Docker or OpenVZ container  1-Make the main UI available to the world:
In the container:
python zeronet.py --ui_ip 0.0.0.0 On the host, you need to configure this container&amp;rsquo;s IP in haproxy &amp;ndash; for instance, edit haproxy.</description>

Use it in your software, use it directly or use it from RootTools: less sucky and MIT licensed!
This set of commands does not suffer from Busybox&amp;rsquo;s limited functionality as the concept is different: it&amp;rsquo;s one binary per command rather than having to load the kitchen sink every time.

      <description>http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhiyunq/pub/sec14_android_activity_inference.pdf
No doubt about that: we are about to hear again about how Android is an inherently insecure OS. It does not matter that the same algorithm would likely work on other mobile devices or, for that matter, any OS.
It&amp;rsquo;s a clever attack. Well, the &amp;ldquo;theft&amp;rdquo; bits of it (invisible activity or photo hijacking) are pretty standard but the first part, the activity detection one, is pretty smart.
Note that it&amp;rsquo;s nothing new though; simply a mix of computer forensics and a timing attack.</description>

      <description>Interesting. So, we already knew that Calico cats cannot be aesthetically cloned since the orange gene is randomly expressed yet, if I am not misusing the lingo, spatially restricted, thus creating orange patches.
Now, it appears that, as should be expected, extrinsic factors such as womb temperature will have a less dramatic yet still relevant effect on other coloring.
In conclusion: I owe my wife an apology for buying into the oft made claim that cats can be visually cloned.</description>

Ansible does not require remote agents but is complex.
Introducing TighBeam: because it works with the same tools sysadmins use all the time. This is a personal project, not some actual open source big deal. I wrote something for myself, keeping it as small as possible. Use it too in a week-end project or what not.

      <description>http://open.citrix.com/blog/328-are-containers-the-right-answer-to-the-wrong-question.html
Russell Pavlicek make some very good points on the containers v. hypervisors race. Of course, he would defend hypervisors; they are his bread and butter after all.
I have to admit, though, that as I read his post, I felt that he was building a straw man as no one is saying that hypervisors will be replaced by containers. However&amp;hellip; I went back to my own recent post(http://nexus.zteo.com/posts/the-next-evolution-of-virtualization/), to confirm my thinking, and re-reading my own words I realize that I totally omitted mentioning one of my favorites things about containers: the fact that they can cohabitate with VMs.</description>

You may know this about me or you may not but over the years I have been a kind of closet futurist: I mean by that that I will occasionally come up with a proof of concept for something that may happen within the next few years but I rarely take the time to do much more at it does not align with my current goals.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed if using this app, any interaction with Spotlight now causes a crash. For instance, dragging a file to Journler means that it will try to display a preview of this file and if it is not sure what type the file is, it attempts to delegate this task to Spotlight and&amp;hellip;scene!
I am aware of the issue and plan on fixing it, unfortunately it is a time consuming task and I have very little free time right now.</description>

      <description>I was reading Yossi Kreinin&amp;rsquo;s quick&amp;rsquo;n fun way to implement coroutines in C and, as an embedded development architect, was a bit saddened by the &amp;ndash; necessary &amp;ndash; use of assembly code to manage a separate stack.
Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s only a few lines of code, but hey, why re-invent the wheel when we can use existing tools and badmouth Posix a little bit in the process?
Posix? Well, yes. Reading his solution it is immediately obvious that rather than setjmp()/longjmp() one could use context management functions.</description>

      <description>The symptom is pretty simple: you click the &amp;lsquo;Memonic&amp;rsquo; extension icon and nothing happens. This patch aims to fix this behavior.
A bit more than three years ago, I published here a patched version of SuperGenPass that would work with Google Chrome. It&amp;rsquo;s been, since then, downloaded more than 1 million times.
Recently, I also published a patched version of Memonic&amp;rsquo;s Android app, patched to work with Jelly Bean.
Today, I bring you a patched version of the Memonic clipper that will work even if you have pesky SVG objects in the page you are trying to capture.</description>

      <description>Need some work ambiance that&amp;rsquo;s not just pure white noise?
The web delivers!
Properly used, after all, noise is supposed to be our creative ally. There is a study touted by various web sites.
Of course, at first there was rainymood. It really is an excellent quality loop. In fact, the web version is, in my opinion, superior to the mobile one, which adds a somewhat disturbing background music.
If you find rainymood&amp;rsquo;s loop not eventful enough, you could give a try to simply rain.</description>

      <description>Well, the Coursera &amp;ldquo;Functional Programming Principles in Scala&amp;rdquo; class was a success. Both Tom Chappell and I really enjoyed it. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve never much liked Eclipse as an IDE. Here is how I am using Sublime Text 2 instead.
Syntax highlighting, error detection
1-Install Sublime Text 2
2- Now, let&amp;rsquo;s prepare our environment for Ensime (aka &amp;ldquo;ENhanced Scala Interaction Mode for Emac&amp;rdquo;) and its &amp;ldquo;sbt&amp;rdquo; plugin:

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Journler&amp;hellip;Again!
Many Mac users are aware of the now abandoned/open-sourced excellent productivity/journaling application known as Journler.
Philip Dow, Journler&amp;rsquo;s author, is obviously a stand-up guy and felt that he needed to work one last time on Journler to add Snow Leopard compatibility while open-sourcing it.
Here we are now, a few years later, and many Mac enthusiasts &amp;ndash; me included &amp;ndash; still use Journler, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not a daily thing.</description>

This is the first post in a series about Virtual Reality in an Enterprise environment. I expect to talk about more positive experiences in future posts but I need to start somewhere, so why not with what did not work for us?
My (and my company&amp;rsquo;s) experience Second Life for Enterprise was a failure, in my case, for several reasons.</description>

      <description>Like many other DEVONthink users, I have started to feel regret that MarkDown is not natively supported.
Now, a piece of good news is that, as long as you edit a plain-text document in DT, you are, in effect, editing a potential MarkDown document.
In the past, it was possible to open a DT document in an application such as the excellent Marked.app. But it is not any longer. I totally understand the author&amp;rsquo;s argument: as a pure viewer, it feels wrong for an application to register as an editor.</description>

      <description>I like things neatly organized. I absolutely hate the idea that I could buy a book I already own. So, it&amp;rsquo;s not surprise that, as a Mac user, I trust Delicious Library to keep tracks of my books, DVS and video games.
As an Android user, I also like that Shelves even exists. After all, it is mostly when I am walking the aisles of Barnes &amp;amp; Noble that I am the most susceptible to wonder whether I already own a given book &amp;ndash; although Amazon may eventually lure me away from that experience &amp;ndash; and if that information is only available on my Mac happily waiting for my return back home, it&amp;rsquo;s not very helpful to me.</description>

      <description>Slider by Yamanaka Tamaki
Hello. Today, I am going to write about persisting a component&amp;rsquo;s values simply, using a hidden dialog; and how to turn a set of classes and assets into a &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; that other developers will not need to refactor prior to using it.
A few months ago, needing an Android widget that would let me select values &amp;ldquo;naturally&amp;rdquo; using one or more sliders, I found Daniel Berndt&amp;rsquo;s excellent DateSlider.</description>

      <description>This is a &amp;ldquo;niche&amp;rdquo; post: it will really only appeal to you if you have access to your own &amp;ndash; or a friend&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; name servers and want to use your own domain to track your dynamic IP addresses, such as your home router&amp;rsquo;s.
You will still have to buy your own domain, cheap if you go to internet.bs or namecheap.com. I hear that the latter even provide their own dynamic DNS service although I cannot tell you anything about its quality/flexibility.</description>

      <description>I am both happy and relieved to announce RootTools 1.5 and NativeTools 1.0.
What&amp;rsquo;s new in RootTools 1.5?
Mostly build improvements: a new AndroidManifest.xml file for easier building in Eclipse; example version number is now taken from the manifest file; new makejar.ant for building and zipping the library.
This version also offers a new function: isNativeToolsready(). This function does a silent install/check for correct install of the nativetools binary (you could conceivably use your own binary as you provide your resource id to the function)</description>

      <guid>https://fusion.github.io/posts/android-statusbar-height-the-cautious-way/</guid>
      <description>A lot of applications expect the status bar to be at the top of your device&amp;rsquo;s screen. It&amp;rsquo;s true in most cases so their developers are somewhat justified in making this assumption.
However, with more and more tablets on the market, this is becoming an increasingly dangerous assumption.
Also somewhat dangerous: the notion that your status bar&amp;rsquo;s height will be (your visible area&amp;rsquo;s height - zero). Google never made any commitment that the status bar will always start at pixel zero.</description>

      <description>A classic problem: you need an array where you are going to hold a set of values; you do not know that array&amp;rsquo;s size in advance but it may grow to be quite the monster.
If you use, say, an ArrayList, you have a memory-hungry beast to deal with, making sure that Android will really think about your app when it needs to kill background processes to reclaim some memory.</description>

      <description>These last few days, the Linux world has paid quite a lot of attention to this kernel patch, written by Mike Galbraith.
Its purpose is to make your desktop more responsive by grouping your tasks so that they have a better chance at getting their fair share of CPU time when some other task, notably a CPU hog, is running in the background. Lennart Poettering then offered his own solution, which requires no tweak of the kernel itself.</description>

      <description>Like many Android developers, I recently realized that pushing a &amp;ldquo;lite&amp;rdquo; version of my application to the Android Marketplace would improve my application&amp;rsquo;s visibility.
(My application: SplitAndTip; light version)
It&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as it seems because Android uses your application&amp;rsquo;s main class&amp;rsquo; full path to identify it. Therefore, simply compiling two versions of the same source code with, say, two different certificates &amp;ndash; the Adobe approach &amp;ndash; does not work.</description>

Apparently, this bug was fixed but a contract was broken in the process: even if packages such as Wikipedia or Drupal were wrong in the way they were passing references, this used to work.</description>

      <description>My first Android application, SplitAndTip , makes splitting a restaurant check with your friends very easy.
One of its key features is that I wanted the user to be able to change any parameter without feeling like the program gets in their way. For instance, you can open the &amp;lsquo;Tax &amp;amp; Tip&amp;rsquo; drawer and quickly change these values.
However, like many, I live and work at the edge of a couple counties and the county tax goes from 8.</description>

 Meanwhile, whilst this particular unlock is the simplest, it also carries with it element of risk that you’re going to want to protect yourself against.
 What? No that&amp;rsquo;s not the correct conclusion. A conclusion that would make more sense is that everybody is at risk until this PDF hole is patched by Apple.</description>

      <title>Freebie: A real blog editing tool</title>

      <description>Until now, this freebie has been known only to my Twitter followers, but considering the positive feedback it received, I am going to put it out there for everybody: a few months ago, being disappointed with the lack of true rich-text editing provided by typical blog editing tools, I started work on mine.
It&amp;rsquo;s still a very unambitious thing but at least it does what every blog owner wants: it allows you to work on your posts in a convenient and intuitive way.</description>

      <description>When you play with an 800-pound gorilla, sometimes, you have to accept that the gorilla will inadvertently stomp on you. After a couple months spent researching a possible strategic realignment, we have decided that it would not be reasonable to spend more time and money on Twitterified, at least not in its current incarnation.
On April 4th 2010, Fred Wilson, who is on Twitter&amp;rsquo;s board of directors, sent a very clear message to application developers: stop writing applications that &amp;ldquo;fill holes in the Twitter product.</description>

      <title>Wordpress Plugin: Page-Theme...themes your pages!</title>

      <description>I was quite surprised, when looking for a way to assign different themes to some pages, to not manage to find an easy way to do that. It is not baked into WordPress, and I could not find a suitable plugin either.
I had, a while ago, created a tiny plugin that did just that for me but it was way too simple and unfriendly to configure. I eventually stumbled upon the &amp;lsquo;domain theme&amp;rsquo; plugin which, even though it does not do what I need, at least showed me that there is a way to perform a proper theme switch cleanly.</description>

      <description>This is not a real article per se. It is more intended to be a conversation because Twitter would make this a tad difficult, with its 140 characters limit.
Two notes on moving to multisites:
1. Wordpress 3.0 final has not been released yet; I have no idea whether a safe upgrade can be guaranteed after enabling multisites
2. Multisites based on subdomains are possible; if you blog is not recent, you will not be offered directory-based sites</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s something I had to do myself recently. It was not quite as painful as I feared it to be.
My aging Wordpress install had certainly gone through its share of hacking: I started with a 1.x version, added multi-blog plugins, uninstalled them, moved to Wordpress MU, then back to single-blog Wordpress. In the process I wrote scripts to rename my tables, added multi- domains plugins&amp;hellip;all the while manually upgrading to various 2.</description>

      <description>Google Analytics. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with it. If not, just know that it&amp;rsquo;s a free service that gives you a pretty accurate idea of why people visit your blog, whether they, in fact, visit it at all, and what kind of demographics they represent. Unless you already use a better, but not free, analytics service, you really have nothing to lose, so just go ahead and sign up.</description>

      <description>Also, ezEdit is very, very, very easy to install and use:
You can add the CMS to your existing website;
You can use it to mock-up updates to your site;
If you are a web designer, you can work on updates with your clients in real-time; and this is without installing anything: simply use the bookmarklet.
ezEdit works as either a very short bootstrap script or a bookmarklet.
The CMS back-end is in a self-contained file as well.</description>

      <description>I am a huge fan of SuperGenPass. There are so many obvious reasons why it&amp;rsquo;s a great concept that I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you with a rehash of all of them.
Unfortunately, in Google Chrome, SuperGenPass chokes on some pages. I do not blame Chrome for that: it&amp;rsquo;s for security reasons.
I&amp;rsquo;ve patched the basic version of SuperGenPass so that it can now work on those pages. I am not sure that it fixes everything for everybody but I hope it makes your life easier, like it does mine.</description>

The same goes for many desktop-based applications.

      <description>Here comes S2ajax v1.0!
And it was long overdue. Six months already since I posted S2ajax says &amp;ldquo;hi()&amp;rdquo; I can hardly believe it.
What I think of as v1.0&amp;rsquo;s main feature is that it is now possible to simply export classes in PHP and these classes can be instantiated in JavaScript. Whenever these instances are modified through asynchronous method calls, these modifications are transparently persisted server-side.
The concept Is it a PHP class?</description>

Here is I how I solved the issue for @mail: I opened library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php , found the line that creates the PDO object (&amp;rdquo; new PDO(&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;) and, in this example, the first argument passed to the constructor was $dsn.</description>

Well, if you have a @gmail.com account, that is.
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry! If you have a Google App account, it can be made to work with little extra work. Here is how:
1. You need a standard @gmail.com account. Create a bogus one if necessary.
2. You will not want to do anything with this account.</description>

Who knows? Someone else might find it useful (it&amp;rsquo;s been downloaded more than 4,500 times since then so I guess that means someone did)
Yesterday a few people commented on that original post, thus reminding me of that plugin. It shamed me when I revisited its packaging to find out that it required from its users to download more pieces left and right.</description>

Since I&amp;rsquo;ve grown frustrated with the inconsistencies between the various code editors that I have been using &amp;ndash; I work on Leopard at home and Ubuntu at work &amp;ndash; I thought that creating my own editor would be the answer to that. Nothing fancy, mind you. Just something consistent.
My first impulse was to use Flex. And it almost worked! Using mx:html I was able to wrap a nice web page in an otherwise very ActionScript-y application.</description>

      <description>Sajax is a ‘managed’ AJAX framework that was created by the fine folks at Modern Method a few years ago.
What’s so great about it is the seamless communication between your back-end and the web page itself: you write your PHP code, tell Sajax which functions to export and they are now accessible from Javascript.
For instance &amp;ndash; from the ‘example_types.php’ file:
function return_string() { return &amp;#34;Name: Tom / Age: 26&amp;#34;; }  The corresponding Javascript call would be:</description>

Unfortunately, if you have modified your Wordpress database prefix, for instance because you are using Wordpress MU or the Virtual Module, the toolbar will fail to display.
Here is my very modest fix that will make it work.

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you renamed your Wordpress tables.
There may be several reasons for this. For instance, you installed Virtual Multiblog to support more than one blog with the same setup.
And now, you are facing the dreaded &amp;ldquo;You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page&amp;rdquo;
What to do, what to do?
Turns out, after some research, I found out that there is a proper procedure for us lazy webmasters:</description>

      <title>A quick-fix for the Tweetback spam issue</title>
      <link>https://fusion.github.io/posts/a-quick-fix-for-the-tweetback-spam-issue/</link>

      <guid>https://fusion.github.io/posts/a-quick-fix-for-the-tweetback-spam-issue/</guid>
      <description>I do not get it. I am a big fan of Smashing Magazine and I think that it was very nice of @jdevalk to write a plug-in that gives us full control over &amp;ldquo;Tweetbacks&amp;rdquo;. See this blog entry.
Where Smashing Magazine and the author lose me, though, is that I have not seen any reaction, either on the magazine&amp;rsquo;s web site, or the author&amp;rsquo;s blog, regarding the issue that many blogs who installed the plug-in seem to now be suffering: they are being inundated with thousands of spammy Tweetbacks, most of them containing text like &amp;ldquo;This is a test&amp;rdquo;, presaging a potentially much more virulent attack when the spammers get their tool working.</description>

      <description>About 10 months ago, I released this tool, allowing developers to handle ExtJS like &amp;ldquo;managed&amp;rdquo; code in PHP: ExtPHP.
Shortly thereafter, Jack Slocum changed ExtJS&amp;rsquo; licensing model and it all became very muddy but my main question was: &amp;ldquo;As a commercial user, what would the status of the extensions be?&amp;rdquo;
It seems that it&amp;rsquo;s OK to create an extension and not GPL it as long as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain any ExtJS original code.</description>

      <description>[It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that Git , as a source code control tool, has become quite popular in 2008, in part boosted by the success of the socially oriented github.com Here is a list of six resources that will help you get more comfy with Git, whatever your current knowledge of the tool.

      <description>A couple years ago, some lad going by the pseudonym of @binderskagnaes, at DeviantArt, released a set of icons on a dark background lovingly named &amp;ldquo;Blaqua.&amp;rdquo;
Then, he ventured to a great forest and got devoured. Or something.
Whatever the reason, he never created more icons, which frankly is a pity.
I am still using his icon set in my Dock, unfortunately the set was created before Twitter got popular, uTorrent or Evernote were released on OS X, etc.</description>

      <description>I know, it&amp;rsquo;s a bold assertion. But, please, bear with me: as a longtime Unix- head, I need a tool that allows me to zoom through my emails rather than click-glance-click-glance-click-yawn-right-click-delete, etc.
For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy with Mutt because nothing compares with using the arrow keys to navigate through my emails, ALT-O to open a folder, SHIFT- O-R to do a reverse-sort, M for a new message, etc.
That, and using Visor, give me the comfort of a HUD-based email management tool whose speed is quite unbeatable.</description>

      <description>I built this driver in 2007, to support Leopard Darwin on my wife&amp;rsquo;s laptop (hmmm where&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;wink wink nudge nudge&amp;rdquo; smiley when you need it?)
I am offering a full driver for download, but it&amp;rsquo;s only so that you could use my keyboard fix if you do not currently have an ApplePS2Controller.kext that support plug-ins.
The point of this driver really is to provide keyboard support for laptops that see their built-in keyboard as PS2 -- ie the vast majority.</description>

      <description>Based on the very helpful feedback I received from the Twitterified client users, here is version 1.2&amp;rsquo;s log:
- Multiple accounts support:
-- Multiple accounts using the same server
-- Accounts using multiple servers (Twitter, Identi.ca&amp;hellip;)
-- Underlying architecture to eventually support any third-party server as long as they are compatible
- Better error reporting
- Better error recovery
- Mouse Gestures support
- Tweets can now be marked &amp;ldquo; read &amp;ldquo;</description>

      <guid>https://fusion.github.io/posts/twitterified-taking-off-is-private-beta-a-mistake/</guid>
      <description>Somehow, seemingly out of nowhere, Twitterers have started to notice Twitterified. I guess a few positive reviews help.
But would Twitterified have received these positive reviews, had it not moved to open beta? I think not. The service was in closed beta for a couple months, which allowed me to kill a few gremlins I found in the system, but even so it did not attract enough adventurous users for its own good.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note: I use VirtualBox daily at work. It provides excellent emulation for my original XP install (the one that came pre-installed on my Dell box!) while my main OS is Ubuntu. Setting up networking is not as straightforward as with VMWare, so here is what I had to do:
First, edit /etc/udev/rules.d/20-names.rules and make sure this line exists:
KERNEL=&amp;#34;tun&amp;#34;, NAME=&amp;#34;net/%k&amp;#34;  Then create this script - you will run it whenever you wish to reconfigure your network:</description>

First, Switzerland is written in Python and will require Psyco. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing since Psyco is all about performance. If you do not have it already installed:</description>

      <description>I cannot believe that it took me so long to get my ducks in a row.
First, Twitterified was entirely written in Javascript, like most AIR clients. But some testing showed that rewriting in AS3 would dramatically increase responsiveness.
Then, I had to work on my web framework while creating twitterified.com. And finally I was only able to offer a decent video thanks to the overall godness offered by Vimeo.</description>

      <description>For my new projects, I have decided to use PHP5 , mostly because at least a couple projects will be worked on by a team and the learning curve is fairly forgiving.
I decided, however, to follow the model offered by Rails. I looked into a few PHP frameworks, such as Akelos, but realized that they were too constraining for our purpose. That&amp;rsquo;s when I decided to develop my own thin layer framework.</description>

I therefore needed a way to insulate them from the gory details, which is why I created ExtPHP.</description>

      <description>UPDATE
MJ7&amp;rsquo;s post, below, reminded me of the existence of this long forgotten post.
As I had written in the comments, this tongue-in-cheek post was not meant to be taken seriously. Please, do not do this.
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is fairly popular.
This is just my modest take on a &amp;lsquo;PHP Object Notation&amp;rsquo; implementation.
Note that it is meant to follow how your mind works rather than being syntactically correct; therefore, associative arrays are used in a loose manner where you have to worry about associative syntax as little as possible.</description>

Bad news: iCalFix is not compatible with the new version of iCal and the latter keeps complaining about the former.
A lot of people have asked the author -BTW: thanks again, Robert, for creating iCalFix when it was needed- how to remove iCalFix but never got a reply.
Here is a veeery simple fix:

 A demo plug-in is now included. All it does is add a new direct word to Kodachi&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary: &amp;lsquo; Demo &amp;lsquo;. Type it, select some action, and it will display a Growl-like notification confirming your action. A very easy starting place for budding plug-in developers.</description>

This week, my frustration over not finding a QuickSilver-like tool for Windows, was at an all-time high.
Do not get me wrong: Colibri and Launchy are fine tools. They just do not have this QuickSilver-like feel that I miss so much at work.
Fortunately, I came upon Kodachi completely by chance and I really like the tool.
Unfortunately, there was no executable available, only source code.</description>

Up until last year, one of my sites was wildly popular: militate.com. Note that after achieving success through word of mouth, it plateaued and never exceeded 300 simultaneous users.</description>

More interesting than his original post, though, I enjoyed reading most comments as well as his own answers to these comments. The phrase &amp;ldquo; Benevolent Dictator &amp;ldquo; emerges fairly early on, and obviously this is what it is about.</description>

      <description>The player I used in my previous post ( &amp;lsquo;nBBS Admin CP&amp;rsquo; ) is now available in the Wordpress.org&amp;rsquo;s plugin directory.
A quick overview:
 This plugin lets you embed a flash stream using Geoff Stearn&amp;rsquo;s player.
 You can embed multiple movies in the same page and/or post.
 You can embed movies in posts and comments.
 You can specify a width and a height to override the default values of 640x480.</description>

      <title>OS X: “Please try installing again”</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s like this message has become a feature of OS X.
You download a .dmg, double-click and expect that all your files should be an exact copy of the original install files. And yet, sometimes, you get stuck with this message.
Here is a very simple fix that works 90% of the time: make sure that your post-install script can be executed!
Open a shell window, go to where your package is, and type:</description>

      <title>Where is getElementsByClassName()?</title>

      <description>Since one of the goals of this blog is to show you how we resolved some of the issues we encounter when writing modern Web applications, allow me to repost this short article that I originall posted at goodjavascript.com
It&amp;rsquo;s an extremely common problem: you want to retrieve all the &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; links embedded in your web page. Or all the text areas with a certain style.
You looked at someone else&amp;rsquo;s code and found that they use the method getElementsByClassName() profusely.</description>

      <title>Create your own WebTop in php/js in no time</title>

      <description>They are everywhere: protopage, pageflakes, netvibes et al are free, easy to use -as long as you have a powerful browser- and moderatly eye-pleasing.
SO?
A couple months ago, I wondered how long it would take me to build my own &amp;lsquo;WebTop&amp;rsquo; (You can play with it here). The challenge would be to get it to a satisfactory state over a week-end.
Of course, I decided to use existing open-source code for the applications&amp;rsquo; primary needs.</description>

      <description>Well, after spending quite some time cleaning up the code, making sure that no &amp;lsquo;dangerous&amp;rsquo; Admin CP operation is available in multi-boards mode, and identifying which settings need to be made immutable, we are almost there.
I am currently working on the automatic setup script. Remaining to do: **mkdir** servers/SERVERID servers/SERVERID/attachments servers/SERVERID/avatars servers/SERVERID/emoticons servers/SERVERID/lang servers/SERVERID/lang/en servers/SERVERID/uploads servers/SERVERID/templates servers/SERVERID/templates/* servers/SERVERID/templates/*_c **cp** servers/SERVERID/emoticons/* servers/SERVERID/templates/*[!_c]/* Note that the only &#39;router&#39; module currently ready is the one based on subdomains.</description>

      <description>In this post:
 Google+ on your Mac, using its own credentials
 Google+ as its own desktop app, with a nice icon
 Using a complex GreaseMonkey script in Safari or Fluid
  I really like Google+ but I have more than one Google account so it was a pain to use because Google&amp;rsquo;s cookies are shared among all Google services and I had to constantly switch accounts.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml ` [outputs] home = [&amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;JSON&amp;quot;] \`</description>

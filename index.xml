      <description>What is this? It is very easy to find blog posts and articles explaining how to make some of these components work together. They are also completely outdated.
It is not their fault: Kubernetes moves fast, Istio&amp;rsquo;s development seems to move even faster, and cert-manager breaks backward compatibility. Chances are, by the time you read it it will be too late!
Anyway, in a futile attempt to remain somewhat ahead of the curve, this article was written for Istio-1.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a solution to build and use your own Zigbee controller. It will work with most Zigbee devices out there, simply because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with any manufacturer-specific assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a fairly short post, as it focuses on using the &lt;code&gt;config-file&lt;/code&gt; library. As previously mentioned, when I mention a library in RasonML&amp;rsquo;s native context, chances are pretty good that I am referring to one of OCaml&amp;rsquo;s many available libraries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before going into how specific features were implemented with Reason and OCaml&amp;rsquo;s help, let&amp;rsquo;s have a quick look at our application&amp;rsquo;s logic&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is by far the most boring piece of this whole endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as we accumulate years of experience, old habits accrete on the programmer and tools such as &lt;code&gt;Make&lt;/code&gt; become an integral part of our fossilized identity. You will have to forgive me for my use of Makefiles!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;installing-reason&#34;&gt;Installing Reason&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will need OCaml. This is because our Reason code will be compiled to OCaml, then, using the OCaml compiler, to native code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe this is, as of now (2018), one of few articles you will find about creating a native application using &lt;a href=&#34;https://reasonml.github.io/&#34;&gt;ReasonML&lt;/a&gt;. While Facebook came up with this interesting language/syntax that compiles to OCaml, it seems that they have focused their energy on transpiling it to JavaScript using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript&#34;&gt;BuckleScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>No doubt about that: we are about to hear again about how Android is an inherently insecure OS. It does not matter that the same algorithm would likely work on other mobile devices or, for that matter, any OS.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;It&#39;s a clever attack. Well, the &amp;quot;theft&amp;quot; bits of it (invisible activity or photo hijacking) are pretty standard but the first part, the activity detection one, is pretty smart.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Note that it&#39;s nothing new though; simply a mix of computer forensics and a timing attack.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;So, how do you protect your data?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In short: it&#39;s not too bad. Read on.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Bad news: not much you can do, at this point, to prevent the &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; part of the attack: it is easy to open a transparent activity; as opposed to a transparent screen overlay, which requires a special set of permissions that MIUI, for instance, denies by default.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Conceivably, though, if your phone is rooted, it would be fairly trivial to write an Xposed module that displays a Toast like: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;    * switching to app_blah *&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Good news, though, regarding the detection bit: as if often the case, I believe that this experiment can only be reproduced in a tightly controlled environment.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;If your device has a different screen resolution/density; if you use an alternate keyboard (in some cases); if you are using a customized ROM; (insert here other factors that would change your activity&#39;s signature); then you are now dramatically lowering the odds that this exploit will work at all.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;These videos are impressive but keep in mind that they were made using the researchers&#39; own devices, not &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;your&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; device.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I am not saying that you are safe, though. I am simply pointing out that this is definitely &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;not&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; a trivial attack and I am sure that as soon as my fellow XDA-ers start giving it some thoughts, a workaround will become available.﻿</description>

      <description>Interesting. So, we already knew that Calico cats cannot be aesthetically cloned since the orange gene is randomly expressed yet, if I am not misusing the lingo, spatially restricted, thus creating orange patches.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Now, it appears that, as should be expected, extrinsic factors such as womb temperature will have a less dramatic yet still relevant effect on other coloring.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In conclusion: I owe my wife an apology for buying into the oft made claim that cats can be visually cloned.﻿</description>

      <description>Russell Pavlicek make some very good points on the containers v. hypervisors race. Of course, he would defend hypervisors; they are his bread and butter after all.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I have to admit, though, that as I read his post, I felt that he was building a straw man as no one is saying that hypervisors will be replaced by containers. However&amp;hellip; I went back to my own recent post(&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nexus.zteo.com/blog/the-next-evolution-of-virtualization/&#34;&gt;http://nexus.zteo.com/blog/the-next-evolution-of-virtualization/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;), to confirm my thinking, and re-reading my own words I realize that I totally omitted mentioning one of my favorites things about containers: the fact that they can cohabitate with VMs.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;When I refer to a future where container-specific applications would exist, I should mention that this is tied not to hypervisors disappearing but instead to the commoditization of VMs. I should have made this explicit.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;On the other hand, I still think his post is a straw man: what I hear from containers evangelists is not that hypervisors are bloated but that VMs are: there is a considerable nuance here as, while VMs are bound (IMO) to become a commodity, hypervisors are going to be an increasingly important tool in a network admin&#39;s toolbelt. However, I believe that, if you wish to take the lead in that particular market, you should start looking into hybrid hypervisors that support these different layers of virtualization (For future reference: &amp;quot;Fractal hypervisors.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; there, I said it)﻿</description>

FreeBlog was born out of frustration after its author tried various blogging software, most of it on the Mac: that type of software usually offers all sorts of features, such as publishing which music you are currently listening to, and seem to forget to focus on the basics: a real rich-text editor that renders your posts as closely to what they will look like on your weblog as possible.</description>

      <title>DEVONthink: MarkDown to Viewer</title>

      <description>Like many other DEVONthink users, I have started to feel regret that MarkDown is not natively supported.Now, a piece of good news is that, as long as you edit a plain-text document in DT, you are, in effect, editing a potential MarkDown document.In the past, it was possible to open a DT document in an application such as the excellent Marked.app. But it is not any longer. I totally understand the author&amp;rsquo;s argument: as a pure viewer, it feels wrong for an application to register as an editor.</description>

      <description>I like things neatly organized. I absolutely hate the idea that I could buy a book I already own. So, it&amp;rsquo;s not surprise that, as a Mac user, I trust Delicious Library to keep tracks of my books, DVS and video games.As an Android user, I also like that Shelves even exists. After all, it is mostly when I am walking the aisles of Barnes &amp;amp; Noble that I am the most susceptible to wonder whether I already own a given book &amp;ndash; although Amazon may eventually lure me away from that experience &amp;ndash; and if that information is only available on my Mac happily waiting for my return back home, it&amp;rsquo;s not very helpful to me. Therefore, Shelves is my saviour.</description>

I hear that the latter even provide their own dynamic DNS service although I cannot tell you anything about its quality/flexibility.</description>

      <description>A lot of applications expect the status bar to be at the top of your device&amp;rsquo;s screen. It&amp;rsquo;s true in most cases so their developers are somewhat justified in making this assumption.However, with more and more tablets on the market, this is becoming an increasingly dangerous assumption.</description>

      <description>A classic problem: you need an array where you are going to hold a set of values; you do not know that array&amp;rsquo;s size in advance but it may grow to be quite the monster.If you use, say, an ArrayList, you have a memory-hungry beast to deal with, making sure that Android will really think about your app when it needs to kill background processes to reclaim some memory.</description>

      <description>These last few days, the Linux world has paid quite a lot of attention to this kernel patch, written by Mike Galbraith.Its purpose is to make your desktop more responsive by grouping your tasks so that they have a better chance at getting their fair share of CPU time when some other task, notably a CPU hog, is running in the background. Lennart Poettering then offered his own solution, which requires no tweak of the kernel itself.</description>

      <description>Once again, the &amp;ndash; otherwise very nice, I&amp;rsquo;m sure &amp;ndash; PHP people have done this thing that has made me miserable with my own open-source code and is now also affecting Mediawiki: in PHP 5.3.1, references passed to __call() are silently turned into values.Apparently, this bug was fixed but a contract was broken in the process: even if packages such as Wikipedia or Drupal were wrong in the way they were passing references, this used to work. Now, when running the same code, not only is a warning issued &amp;ndash; good &amp;ndash; but the function is not called. The latter is quite hard to justify.Of course, this means that a simple “dot” upgrade can render your whole website unusable; it’s a pill that’s a tad hard to swallow.</description>

      <description>My first Android application, SplitAndTip, makes splitting a restaurant check with your friends very easy.One of its key features is that I wanted the user to be able to change any parameter without feeling like the program gets in their way. For instance, you can open the ‘Tax &amp;amp; Tip’ drawer and quickly change these values.However, like many, I live and work at the edge of a couple counties and the county tax goes from 8.25% to a whopping 9.75% (L.A. County of course!)It is a tedious proposition to re-enter the same two percentages every time I cross the “border.”On a desktop computer, this is usually addressed through the use of a drop-down list. However the Android UI does not have room for a full-size selection component, unless you add more steps by popping one up every time you wish to adjust a value. This is no friendly user interface.The solution I found is a text field that will provide suggestions based on past values, while remaining in the text field itself.</description>

It is now a well established fact.Rumor has it, iOS4.1 should really make your iPhone faster.</description>

      <guid>http://zteo.com/posts/wordpress-thesis-gpl-the-facts-are-simple/</guid>
      <description>Update:Now a few days later, Thesis has been GPL&amp;rsquo;d and there isn&amp;rsquo;t much left to say on this topic. However, for the sake of clarity, I would like to revisit a statement I made below: if Thesis contained &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; original WordPress code, considering that it is distributed on its own, and not shipped with a copy of WordPress, I am not sure how a court would see this. It is the intent of the GPL license that anything &amp;ldquo;linked&amp;rdquo; against GPL code becomes de facto GPL (if the executable and GPL code &amp;ldquo;make function calls to each other and share data structures&amp;rdquo;) but I am not aware of a case where &amp;ldquo;linking&amp;rdquo; was the only, successfully argued point.</description>

      <description>When you play with an 800-pound gorilla, sometimes, you have to accept that the gorilla will inadvertently stomp on you. After a couple months spent researching a possible strategic realignment, we have decided that it would not be reasonable to spend more time and money on Twitterified, at least not in its current incarnation.On April 4th 2010, Fred Wilson, who is on Twitter&amp;rsquo;s board of directors, sent a very clear message to application developers: stop writing applications that &amp;ldquo;fill holes in the Twitter product.&amp;ldquo;Emphasizing his point, Twitter quickly went on to buy Tweetie and declaring it its official client.</description>

      <guid>http://zteo.com/posts/wordpress-plugin-page-themethemes-your-pages/</guid>
      <description>I was quite surprised, when looking for a way to assign different themes to some pages, to not manage to find an easy way to do that. It is not baked into WordPress, and I could not find a suitable plugin either.I had, a while ago, created a tiny plugin that did just that for me but it was way too simple and unfriendly to configure. I eventually stumbled upon the &amp;lsquo;domain theme&amp;rsquo; plugin which, even though it does not do what I need, at least showed me that there is a way to perform a proper theme switch cleanly.Note: if you&amp;rsquo;ve been reading this intro, thinking: &amp;ldquo;But there is a way to switch templates!&amp;quot;, then you&amp;rsquo;re right because there is; however I am not talking about templates but themes. Templates are pre-recorded page structures whereas themes are about changing your blog&amp;rsquo;s complete look and feel, including logo, stylesheet, etc.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s something I had to do myself recently. It was not quite as painful as I feared it to be.My aging Wordpress install had certainly gone through its share of hacking: I started with a 1.x version, added multi-blog plugins, uninstalled them, moved to Wordpress MU, then back to single-blog Wordpress. In the process I wrote scripts to rename my tables, added multi-domains plugins&amp;hellip;all the while manually upgrading to various 2.x releases.Things stopped working. Helpful things, such as JavaScript, just about everywhere.</description>

      <description>Google Analytics. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with it. If not, just know that it&amp;rsquo;s a free service that gives you a pretty accurate idea of why people visit your blog, whether they, in fact, visit it at all, and what kind of demographics they represent. Unless you already use a better, but not free, analytics service, you really have nothing to lose, so just go ahead and sign up.</description>

      <description>Also, ezEdit is very, very, very easy to install and use:
You can add the CMS to your existing website;
You can use it to mock-up updates to your site;
If you are a web designer, you can work on updates with your clients in real-time; and this is without installing anything: simply use the bookmarklet.
ezEdit works as either a very short bootstrap script or a bookmarklet.
The CMS back-end is in a self-contained file as well.</description>

      <description>If, like me, your company&amp;rsquo;s insistence on using Sharepoint as an Intranet tool contributes to rapid neurons death, there is as least a glimmer of hope: you can still use Firefox without being punished by having to type raw HTML code when editing a page (Sharepoint, unsurprisingly, only likes IE)</description>

      <description>bespin is really an intriguing project. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve grown frustrated with the inconsistencies between the various code editors that I have been using &amp;ndash; I work on Leopard at home and Ubuntu at work &amp;ndash; I thought that creating my own editor would be the answer to that. Nothing fancy, mind you. Just something consistent.</description>

      <description>Sajax is a ‘managed’ AJAX framework that was created by the fine folks at Modern Method a few years ago.What’s so great about it is the seamless communication between your back-end and the web page itself: you write your PHP code, tell Sajax which functions to export and they are now accessible from Javascript.</description>

      <description>I do not get it. I am a big fan of Smashing Magazine and I think that it was very nice of @jdevalk to write a plug-in that gives us full control over &amp;ldquo;Tweetbacks&amp;rdquo;. See this blog entry.Where Smashing Magazine and the author lose me, though, is that I have not seen any reaction, either on the magazine&amp;rsquo;s web site, or the author&amp;rsquo;s blog, regarding the issue that many blogs who installed the plug-in seem to now be suffering: they are being  inundated with thousands of spammy Tweetbacks, most of them containing text like &amp;ldquo;This is a test&amp;rdquo;, presaging a potentially much more virulent attack when the spammers get their tool working.In fact, it may not be spam, but simply some tests gone wrong, but whatever the reason it caused grief to many blog owners &amp;ndash; including me.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that Git, as a source code control tool, has become quite popular in 2008, in part boosted by the success of the socially oriented github.com Here is a list of six resources that will help you get more comfy with Git, whatever your current knowledge of the tool. Let me know if you think that, after reading these six documents, you can still point to a few stones left unturned.3 Reasons To Switch To Git From Subversion A to-the-point document, created by Mark McBride, that covers several scenarios and for each scenario, shows how Git could make your life easier if you are not using it yet.</description>

      <description>A couple years ago, some lad going by the pseudonym of @binderskagnaes, at DeviantArt, released a set of icons on a dark background lovingly named &amp;ldquo;Blaqua.&amp;rdquo;
Then, he ventured to a great forest and got devoured. Or something.
Whatever the reason, he never created more icons, which frankly is a pity.
I am still using his icon set in my Dock, unfortunately the set was created before Twitter got popular, uTorrent or Evernote were released on OS X, etc.</description>

      <description>I cannot believe that it took me so long to get my ducks in a row.First, Twitterified was entirely written in Javascript, like most AIR clients. But some testing showed that rewriting in AS3 would dramatically increase responsiveness.Then, I had to work on my web framework while creating twitterified.com. And finally I was only able to offer a decent video thanks to the overall godness offered by Vimeo.But hey, here it is! For a limited period of time, if you go to the invite page and enter the code &amp;ldquo;nexus&amp;rdquo;, you will be automatically added to the private beta program.</description>

      <description>For my new projects, I have decided to use PHP5, mostly because at least a couple projects will be worked on by a team and the learning curve is fairly forgiving.I decided, however, to follow the model offered by Rails.  I looked into a few PHP frameworks, such as Akelos, but realized that they were too constraining for our purpose. That&amp;rsquo;s when I decided to develop my own thin layer framework.</description>

      <description>It is something that I had to think about in my day job, because my team is migrating to PHP for web development and I believe that we simply do not have enough time for them to learn JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s intricacies, I needed to be the one person who would have to wrestle JavaScript when problems happened. I therefore needed a way to insulate them from the gory details, which is why I created ExtPHP.As you may have guessed from subtle hints, such as this entry&amp;rsquo;s 12-feet tall header, ExtPHP creates a PHP wrapper for ExtJS.</description>

      <description>Great news: with Leopard, there is no need for iCalFix anymore!Bad news: iCalFix is not compatible with the new version of iCal and the latter keeps complaining about the former.A lot of people have asked the author -BTW: thanks again, Robert, for creating iCalFix when it was needed- how to remove iCalFix but never got a reply.</description>

      <title>Kodachi 0.5.1 now skinnable (and more)</title>
      <link>http://zteo.com/posts/kodachi-051-now-skinnable-and-more/</link>

      <description>Kodachi v0.5.1 is out! It&amp;rsquo;s good news for developers who want to write plug-ins or if you wish to change the look and feel of the application:	A demo plug-in is now included.  All it does is add a new direct word to Kodachi&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary: &amp;lsquo;Demo&amp;rsquo;. Type it, select some action, and it will display a Growl-like notification confirming your action. A very easy starting place for budding plug-in developers.-	Kodachi&amp;rsquo;s user interface is now skinnable. Actually this goes a bit beyond a simple skin as you can change its behaviour alltogether. Note that when launching Kodachi, you will now see the new demo skin, called &amp;lsquo;Bezel&amp;rsquo;, that I created. If you are familiar with QuickSilver, this is certainly an interface you are already used to. If you wish to work with the old interface, simply disable the &amp;lsquo;BezelInterface&amp;rsquo; plug-in.-	The installer now checks which version of .Net is installed on your PC, if any, and offers to install the correct version if necessary.Download Kodachi 0.5.1</description>

      <description>Why would I want Kiali? If you have been playing/using a service mesh for any length of time, you may have noticed that there is a certain cognitive overhead in trying to figure out traffic flows. Even using the CLI to understand injected routes can require spending a good long time in the &amp;ldquo;zone.&amp;rdquo;

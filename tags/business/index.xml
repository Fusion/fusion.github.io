      <description>A quick note on something currently mistifying me.
Dan Ariely&amp;rsquo;s Predictably Irrational is a wonderful book, full of studies and academic research and whose sole purpose is to make us feel bad about how far from smart we can be, when it comes to marketing.
 Predicably Irrational  Get this book!     In it, he goes beyong simply describing price anchoring, which is the practice of steering your mind towards what the seller thinks is a fair price, and would really like you to agree that, why, but of course it is!</description>

      <description>Obviously, this post is MacOS-specific. This is about when Fusion throws the dreaded
 /dev/vmmon: broken pipe
 or
 /dev/vmmon: No such file or directory
 Here are three different fixes, because this is definitely nor a &amp;ldquo;one size fits all&amp;rdquo; scenario:
1-If Fusion complains about not being authorized Go to the Security and Privacy control panel; make sure that both App Store and signed applications are authorized; check that Fusion is not explicitely blacklisted.</description>

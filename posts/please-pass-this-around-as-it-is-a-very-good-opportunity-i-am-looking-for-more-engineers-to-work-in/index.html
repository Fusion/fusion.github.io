                  <p>Please pass this around as it is a very good opportunity: I am looking for
more engineers to work in several of my teams.</p>

<p>Who I am looking for:<br />
- you are comfortable developing using C, C++ and/or Java<br />
- you either work with embedded systems (looking at you Droiders or switch
developers) or large web applications or SDN controllers</p>

<p>Who we are:<br />
- think of us as a startup with great benefits<br />
- by that I mean health coverage, 401k, salary in the high 90s to 100ks<br />
- we pay relocation expenses if necessary<br />
- we are established, with a solid revenue stream<br />
- and yet, we also work on multiple, very forward looking projects<br />
- we are located in Southern California, near L.A.</p>

<p>I am posting this here before making it more widely available as I&rsquo;d rather
work with one of you guys so, if you are interested or think one of your
friends might be a match, let me know immediately.ï»¿</p>

		<p class="post-excerpt">I love the idea of Switzerland, the new EFF tool for checking ISP throttling ; unfortunately as of release Zero.0.5, Leopard seems to still be a mere afterthought. Here is how I worked around the few things that were not working out of the box.
First, Switzerland is written in Python and will require Psyco. It&rsquo;s a good thing since Psyco is all about performance. If you do not have it already installed:</p>

		<p class="post-excerpt">I cannot believe that it took me so long to get my ducks in a row.
First, Twitterified was entirely written in Javascript, like most AIR clients. But some testing showed that rewriting in AS3 would dramatically increase responsiveness.
Then, I had to work on my web framework while creating twitterified.com. And finally I was only able to offer a decent video thanks to the overall godness offered by Vimeo.</p>

		<p class="post-excerpt">For my new projects, I have decided to use PHP5 , mostly because at least a couple projects will be worked on by a team and the learning curve is fairly forgiving.
I decided, however, to follow the model offered by Rails. I looked into a few PHP frameworks, such as Akelos, but realized that they were too constraining for our purpose. That&rsquo;s when I decided to develop my own thin layer framework.</p>

Steve Yegge&rsquo;s ramblings will enlighten you or depress you, but at least they are enjoyable. There, on my list, right under Joel Spolsky (all-time Nerd Superstar).
Clustering and Cloud Computing
The Helmer Cluster, but only because I can also be a hardware nerd.

		<p class="post-excerpt">When things start smelling &ldquo;funny&rdquo; in the open-source community, they tend to go to the dogs with the haste of a drunk marching band.
Today&rsquo;s drama is brought to you by your friendly ExtJS community. For those of you not familiar with ExtJS, it is a professionally made Javascript library that allows web application developers to create very elaborate desktop-like applications. Jack Slocum originally started this project as a YUI extension.</p>

		<p class="post-excerpt">It is something that I had to think about in my day job, because my team is migrating to PHP for web development and I believe that we simply do not have enough time for them to learn JavaScript&rsquo;s intricacies, I needed to be the one person who would have to wrestle JavaScript when problems happened. I therefore needed a way to insulate them from the gory details, which is why I created ExtPHP.</p>

		<p class="post-excerpt">UPDATE
MJ7&rsquo;s post, below, reminded me of the existence of this long forgotten post.
As I had written in the comments, this tongue-in-cheek post was not meant to be taken seriously. Please, do not do this.
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is fairly popular.
This is just my modest take on a &lsquo;PHP Object Notation&rsquo; implementation.
Note that it is meant to follow how your mind works rather than being syntactically correct; therefore, associative arrays are used in a loose manner where you have to worry about associative syntax as little as possible.</p>

As an early adopter, I am very happy to see the project evolve this way. In case you are not familiar with Liferay, they develop open-source products, so all is well :)</p>

		<p class="post-excerpt">Great news: with Leopard, there is no need for iCalFix anymore!
Bad news: iCalFix is not compatible with the new version of iCal and the latter keeps complaining about the former.
A lot of people have asked the author -BTW: thanks again, Robert, for creating iCalFix when it was needed- how to remove iCalFix but never got a reply.
Here is a veeery simple fix:
Simply remove the input manager from /Library/InputManagers</p>
